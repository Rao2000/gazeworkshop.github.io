    <p>
The 1st Workshop on Gaze Estimation and Prediction in the Wild (GAZE 2019) at ICCV 2019 is the first-of-its-kind workshop focused on designing and evaluating deep learning methods for the task of gaze estimation and prediction. We aim to encourage and highlight novel strategies with a focus on robustness and accuracy in real-world settings. This is expected to be achieved via novel neural network architectures, incorporating anatomical insights and constraints, introducing new and challenging datasets, and exploiting multi-modal training among other directions. This half-day workshop consists of three invited talks as well as lightning talks from industry contributors.

    <h2>Call for Extended Abstracts</h2>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-12">
    <p>
      In addition to regular papers, we also invite extended abstracts of ongoing or published work (<i>e.g.</i> related papers on ICCV main track). The extended abstracts will not be published or made available to the public (we will only list titles on our website) but will rather be presented during our poster session. We see this as an opportunity for authors to promote their work to an interested audience to gather valuable feedback.
    </p>
    <p>Extended abstracts are limited to three pages and must be created using <a href="/static/GAZE 2019 Extended Abstract Template.zip" title="GAZE 2019 Extended Abstracts Template">this LaTeX template</a>. The submission must be sent to <a href="mailto:gaze.iccv19@gmail.com">gaze.iccv19@gmail.com</a> by 6th September.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will evaluate and notify authors of acceptance as soon as possible after receiving their extended abstract submission.
